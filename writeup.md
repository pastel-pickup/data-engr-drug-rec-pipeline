# PeopleRX: A Drug Recommendation System For The People by The People
Mai Tran

# Abstract
Drug recommendation system, PeopleRX, serves as a clinical decision support (CDS) system to help both healthcare providers and patients to be more informed in choosing the most appropriate drugs for fast and efficient treatment without painful side effects, long wait time, uncertainty, human error, costs, and all other unpleasant experiences associated with long clinical drug trials. The recommender was successfully built using a data pipeline starting from a SQLite database, getting transformed in Python via Streamlit, and getting deployed to the web via Streamlit.
